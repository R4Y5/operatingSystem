          <b>An operating system (OS)</b> is the foundational software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources. 
          It acts as the intermediary layer between the user and the machine, enabling applications to run without.
          needing to interact directly with hardware.
        <br><br>
          More formally, an operating system can be defined as a collection
          of programs that control and coordinate the use of hardware among
          various application programs for various users. It is the first
          software loaded when a computer starts up — a process known as
          booting — and it remains active in memory for as long as the
          computer is running.
        <br><br>
          Think of the OS as the backbone of a computer system. Just as a
          building needs a structural foundation before floors, walls, and
          rooms can be added, a computer needs an OS before any application
          — a word processor, a game, a web browser — can function. Without
          it, hardware components such as the CPU, RAM, and storage devices
          would have no coordinated way to communicate or serve any useful
          purpose. 
          <br><br>
          Without an operating system, a computer is essentially unusable
          for general purposes. Every task you perform — opening a browser,
          saving a file, streaming a video — is coordinated and made
          possible by the OS working silently in the background.
